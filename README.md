##Project Name
  JavaWorks a local coffeeshop search app for remote developers

##Elevator Pitch
  My project called JavaWorks is an app for remote workers(like developers) to use to find local coffeeshops in the area that offer the best wifi speeds, detailed description of comfortability, and price of items..

##Desired Outcome
  Who is my target users?
  -Remote developers and remote workers

##What does it give them??
  Helps to search for local coffeeshops in the area that have the best work environment for them.

##Evidence of success
  You will be able to find the coffeeshop that fits your criteria the best. Whether your more interested in how comfortable the chairs are, how big the tables are, if noise levels bother you, how expensive the menu is(cheapest thing on the menu to buy).

##Consequences that could happen in the result of using the app
  -The info could be wrong or obsolete..
  -Not quick enough with the updated info.
  -Location could be wrong.

##Why don't they have it already??
  -Not many other apps like this.
  -People just go to the nearest coffeeshop and hope for the best
  -Too many features on other apps
